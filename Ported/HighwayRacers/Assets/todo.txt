    *positions = new UnsafeList(UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<TrackPos>(), UnsafeUtility.AlignOf<TrackPos>(), nCarsPerSegment, Allocator.Persistent);
    *speeds = new UnsafeList(UnsafeUtility.SizeOf<Speed>(), UnsafeUtility.AlignOf<Speed>(), nCarsPerSegment, Allocator.Persistent);

        consider allocating these unsafelists all contiguously


    sorting of buckets might pay off?


clicks on menu windows shouldn't register as clicks on cars

why are any cars turqouise (default shader color)
    V2 hybrid define might fix it?

switch to Schedule() / ScheduleParallel() 

use float2's instead of float3's
use half instead of float


jobify CarsByLaneSegmentation (each job targets different segment; each job reads all the cars)

profile with different segmentation sizes
