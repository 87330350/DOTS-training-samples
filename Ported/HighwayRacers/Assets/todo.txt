BUGS:

* check if end overtake merge check looks back properly
        increase the mergeLookBehind distance? 

*   clicks on menu windows shouldn't register as clicks on cars
*   rendering exceptions?: IsFinite(distanceForSort)  IsFinite(distanceAlongView)
           triggered when moving scene view camera down the road

OPTIMIZE:

*   use float2's instead of float3's


*   try smaller segments sizes
*   alternate which segments test for merging in a frame


 
*   split Car so that Pos Lane and Speed are own struct in separate set of buckets 
 
*   check if all translations and rotations aren't NaN or Infinity (check unity.mathematics)
        check the matrices
 
 
* custom color override / shader  
  
* write groups?
