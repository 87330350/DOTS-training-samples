BUGS:

*   clicks on menu windows shouldn't register as clicks on cars
*   rendering exceptions?: IsFinite(distanceForSort)  IsFinite(distanceAlongView)
           triggered when moving scene view camera down the road

OPTIMIZE:

*   use float2's instead of float3's
*   use half instead of float
*   try smaller segments sizes
*   alternate which segments test for merging in a frame 
*   instead of Translation and Rotation, convert directly to LocalToWorld
*   what if we only sorted a bucket every few frames? might get erroneously moved to next bucket?
*   split Car so that Pos Lane and Speed are own struct in separate set of buckets
